# jQuery Interconnected Sliders

jQuery Interconnected Sliders is a tool to create sets of sliders that add up to a defined value -- a way of representing user controlled proportions of a fixed resource (say a percentage, a distribution of money or any other constrained value spread over multiple categories). 

jQuery Interconnected Sliders is dependent on jQuery and [$.noUiSlider](http://refreshless.com/nouislider/). We use noUiSlider instead of jQuery UI Slider both because of weight and out-of-the-box appearance.

## Instructions

1. Create your noUiSliders appropriately, styled as you wish, with any settings you wish. They should all have the same range (0 to 100, for example).
